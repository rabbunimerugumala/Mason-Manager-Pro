/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for Construction Site Management App.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model. Each user has full control over their data tree.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * All data is nested under /users/{userId}, ensuring complete isolation between users.  Each user owns places, daily records, and payment rates.
 *  - /users/{userId}
 *  - /users/{userId}/places/{placeId}
 *  - /users/{userId}/places/{placeId}/dailyRecords/{dailyRecordId}
 *  - /users/{userId}/places/{placeId}/paymentRates/{paymentRateId}
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only access their own data. No cross-user data access is allowed through security rules.
 * - Data consistency between paths and document IDs is enforced on create and update operations.
 * - All write operations require an authenticated user.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * The data structure denormalizes user and place IDs into subcollection documents. This enables fast, simple rules without costly `get()` operations.
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 * User-specific data is stored under the /users/{userId} path, ensuring private data is not accidentally exposed.
